A plugin to migrate categories, posts, tags, images and other medias from Joomla to WordPress

== Description ==

This plugin migrates sections, categories, posts, images, medias and tags from Joomla to Wordpress.

It has been tested with **Joomla 1.5** and **Wordpress 3.3.1** on huge databases (72 000+ posts)

Major features include:

* migrates Joomla sections as categories
* migrates categories as sub-categories
* migrates Joomla posts
* uploads all the posts media in WP uploads directories (in option)
* modifies the post content to keep the media links
* resizes images according to the sizes defined in WP
* defines the thumbnail to be the first post image
* keeps the alt image attribute
* modifies the internal links
* migrates meta keywords as tags

== Installation ==

1.  Extract plugin zip file and load up to your wp-content/plugin directory
2.  Activate Plugin in the Admin => Plugins Menu
3.  Run the importer in Tools > Import > Joomla 1.5 (FG)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= All the posts are not migrated. Why ? =

* The archived posts or posts put in trash are not migrated. But unpublished posts are migrated as drafts.

= The migration stops and I get the message: "Fatal error: Allowed memory size of XXXXXX bytes exhausted" =

* You can run the migration again. It will continue where it stopped. You can also increase the memory limit in php.ini if you have write access to this file.

= The media are not migrated and I get the error message: "Warning: copy() [function.copy]: URL file-access is disabled in the server configuration" =

* The PHP directive "Allow URL fopen" must be turned on in php.ini to copy the medias. If your remote host doesn't allow this directive, you will have to do the migration on localhost.

= I get the message: "Fatal error: Class 'PDO' not found" =

* PDO and PDO_MySQL libraries are needed. You must enable them in php.ini.
